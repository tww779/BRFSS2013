# BRFSS2013

**Context**
The BRFSS study examines non-institutionalized adults over 18 years of age. As the Data User Guide stated, the study expanded to all American states and territories after 2001. In order to identify long-term trends, data scientists need to refer to the Comparability of Data document for recommended methods. Although the BRFSS data set is limited to 2013 and 2014, the study was designed to account for differences in population density, race, residence, and telephone method, and time survey is conducted. 

Some of the BRFSS study's biases can be attributed to the population pool sampled and method. Disproportionate stratified sampling was used to distinguish high and low geographic densities in the United States. This method was selected for cost efficiency. However, the study excludes institutionalized or homeless persons. It is possible variables related to income and health are not accurately represented.

The purpose of this exploratory data analysis is to examine habits of people self-identified with at least good health. The research questions evaluate observations from 2013 and 2014 to identify habits associated with fruit and vegetable consumption, along with types of physical exercise.
